Custom Home Assistant integration for [Solvis Heating Devices](https://www.solvis.de/) 

## Install
### HACS
The easiest way to install this component is by clicking the badge below, which adds this repo as a custom repo in your HASS instance.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?category=Integration&owner=LarsK1&repository=hass_solvis_control)

You can also add the integration manually by copying `custom_components/solvis_control` into `<HASS config directory>/custom_components`

# Preparation:
To be able to use this integration the solvis device needs an enabled modbus socket. To do so go to your device:
- Go to the installateur menu (code : 0064)
- "Sonstiges"
